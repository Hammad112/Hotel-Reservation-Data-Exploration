# HotelReservationInsights

Welcome to the HotelReservationInsights repository! This project focuses on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Hotel Reservation Dataset and prepares the data for Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning algorithms.

## Repository Content

### 1. Data Structure
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to hotel reservations, such as booking details, customer information, and stay specifics. Here's an overview of the data structure:

- **Data Info:** 
  ```bash
   data.info() 
   ```
    

- **Data Description:**
           
  ```bash
   data.describe()
   ``` 

- **Data Shape:**
  ```bash
   data.shape
   ```
 

### 2. Missing Values
Handling missing values is a crucial step in data preprocessing. In this project, we identify and address missing values to ensure data quality.
  
  ```bash
   data.isnull().sum()
   ```

- **Handling Missing Values:**
  - For numerical columns: Imputed with the mean or median.
  - For categorical columns: Imputed with the mode or a placeholder value.


### 3. Duplicates
Duplicate entries can skew analysis and model performance. We identify and remove duplicate rows to maintain data integrity.

  ```bash
   data.duplicated().sum()
   ```
- **Action Taken:**
  Removed all duplicate rows to ensure unique records in the dataset.
  ```bash
   data.drop(columns=['colname'],inplace=True)
   ```

### 4. Encoding Categorical Variables
Many ML algorithms require numerical input. We convert categorical variables into numerical values using encoding techniques.

- **Ordinal Encoding:**
  - **Label Encoding:** For ordinal categorical variables to assign diff integers for each.
  - **Ordinal Encoding**: describes the order
- **Nominal Encoding:**
  - **One-Hot Encoding:** For nominal categorical variables.
  - **Features Encoding**
  - **Binary Encoding**

### 5. Data Preparation for ML and Deep Learning
After cleaning and preprocessing, the dataset is prepared for ML and Deep Learning algorithms. This includes:

- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that enhance the predictive power of the models.
- **Scaling:** Standardizing numerical features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **Train-Test Split:** Dividing the data into training and test sets for model evaluation.

## Key Features

- **Visual Insights:** Graphical representations of booking trends, seasonal patterns, and customer behaviors.
- **Data Cleaning:** Detailed steps to preprocess raw data, ensuring it's ready for model training.
- **Feature Engineering:** Techniques to create informative features for ML and Deep Learning models.
- **Model-Ready Data:** Prepared datasets suitable for various predictive modeling tasks.
